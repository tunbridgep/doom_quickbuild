# Doom Quickbuild
A simple build script for building doom projects into a coherent pk3 file, with ACC compilation, DECORATE/ZSCRIPT index generation, and bundling handled for you.

#Installing
You need to have PHP available in your path.

On linux, php can be installed with

    sudo apt-get install php

On windows, PHP can be downloaded from php.net and installed to anywhere. There are plenty of guides online which talk about how to add a folder to your PATH

Once you have PHP installed, just copy the folder structure into your project. That should be the build folder, make.sh and config.json

#Setting up
All settings can be configures in config.json
